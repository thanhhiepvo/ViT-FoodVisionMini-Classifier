# ViT FoodVisionMini Classifier

This repository implements a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model for classifying food images, specifically **pizza**, **steak**, and **sushi**, using a **FoodVision Mini subset (10%)** dataset.

## üìö Description

The **FoodVisionMini** dataset contains labeled images of various food items. In this project:
- A **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model is fine-tuned for image classification.
- Images are preprocessed and augmented for optimal training.
- Model performance is evaluated and visualized across training and test datasets.

### üîë Key Highlights:
- State-of-the-art **ViT architecture** for image classification.
- Focus on **pizza, steak, and sushi** image categories.
- Dataset subset: **10% sample** of FoodVisionMini.
- Model training, evaluation, and visualization using **PyTorch**.
